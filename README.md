shell-utilities
===============

Items that live in my `~/bin` but I tend to put my own scripts and convenient small scripts into `~/util` (which is what this repo will be) to ensure no possibility of conflicts.

These are scripts that I have created which I think are worth saving in a VCS. Random scripts such as `subl` for running Sublime Text, or various builds of binary programs like `tmux`, etc., do not belong here. If I ever make a repo to store OSX binaries it will be separate from this. This repo will contain mostly shell scripts or node scripts that are at least slightly POSIX compatible.
